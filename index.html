        We are Team 6837: Cannon C.R.A.S.H. (Coding, Robotics, Automation & Scripting Herd)—a rookie FTC team. Our name embodies our core belief: the most powerful learning happens when something breaks and we must rebuild it better than before. We are a group that values resilience, iteration, and growth through challenge. Our team proudly “CRASH‑es out” at the end of every meeting, celebrating both our efforts and the lessons learned along the way. <br> <br>
        In our first year, we’ve quickly discovered that robotics is a dynamic mix of building, coding, testing, failing, debugging, and—often—laughing together when things don’t go as planned, right up until the moment they finally do. We meet weekly on Mondays from 4:30 to 7:00 PM, with additional practice sessions and virtual meetings scheduled as competition deadlines approach. <br> <br>
        Together, we are more than a new team—we are a learning community built on curiosity, collaboration, and the courage to crash, rebuild, and succeed. <br> <br>
